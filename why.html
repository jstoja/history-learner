				<h4 class="plsi-title">Why?</h2>
				<p>Letâ€™s say that you are interested in machine learning, and a lot of mathematical stuff. You've made a lot of research on websites about that. You asked information about a classification subject, about a probabilistic model, etc.</p>
				<p>In the other hand, you are developing a website from scratch. Then, you made several researchs about the Web, the Semantic and the different user-agent for the CSS.</p>
				<p>The History Learner will extract your history and define 2 topics:
					<ul>
						<li>The first one with : "classification, probabilistic, learning" terms</li>
						<li>And the other one with "web, semantic, css" terms.</li>
					</ul>

				<h4 class="plsi-title">Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analisys</h2>
				<p>Compared to standard latent semantic analysis which stems from linear algebra and downsizes the occurrence tables, probabilistic latent semantic analysis is based on a mixture decomposition derived from a latent class model.</p>
